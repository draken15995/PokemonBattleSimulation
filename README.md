"# PokemonBattleSimulation" 
This is the very first piece of code/programming that I have built on my journey to learn full-stack development. It's relatively simple now (as of 7/3/24) but I plan to continue adding onto it. Feel free to share any constructive criticism! Always looking to learn new ways to make my coding better and more efficient!
